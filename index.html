 <p>Mowgli is a young boy from Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book" who was raised by wolves in the Indian jungle after being lost as a baby, learning to survive amongst the animals with the help of his wolf family and friends like Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther, while facing threats from the menacing tiger, Shere Khan; he is often referred to as the "Man-Cub" due to his human nature despite living in the wild</p>
