    <h3> Here is a information of RAKSHA</h3>
    <h2> Summary:</h2>
    <p>Raksha (or Mother Wolf as initially named) was a female Indian wolf, and member of the Seeonee pack, who while suckling her own cubs decides also to adopt a man-cub that her mate, Rama had found wandering in the jungle, naming him "Mowgli" (which means "frog" in the Speech of the Jungle) because of his hairlessness.
        Defying the tiger Shere Khan, who was determined to kill the man-cub, she revealed that her name was Raksha (which means "The Demon") because of her ferocity as a fighter, and she would fight to the death for any of her cubs, natural or adopted.  </p>
